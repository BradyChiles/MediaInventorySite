## MediaInventorySite

This was a group project for Advanced C# class. We decided to create a media inventory tracker. The application will allow you to sign in so that you can enter new items as well as view/edit what you currently have. It uses a database in the backend to hold information about uer logins so that they can be validated, and so that their items are only displayed to them. I was in charge of making sure that the items could be successfully added and that they would be attributed to the correct user. After completing that I went on to help my other teammates finish their portions.
